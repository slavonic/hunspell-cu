Church Slavonic spelling dictionaries for Hunspell

This package provides spelling dictionaries for Church Slavonic
for [Hunspell](https://hunspell.github.io/).

## Quick Start

Copy the `cu.aff` and `cu.dic` files into the Hunspell directory
(probably `/usr/share/hunspell/`).

Extensions also exist for LibreOffice and other software, which
are based on this package.

## Issues

At present, this is a poorman's spell checker:

- Cyrillic numerals may be treated as mispelled
- The dictionary does not provide any morphology

Morphological analysis for Church Slavonic is hard to do. Since
we presently don't have the resources to write morphology into
the dictionary, the spell checker will only check the words present
in the dictionary. In other words, if the dictionary contains:

```
кни́га
кни́гꙋ
кни́зи
```

The spell checker will recognize these words, but it will treat
`кни́зѣ`, `кни́гами` and `кни́жный` as mispelled.
