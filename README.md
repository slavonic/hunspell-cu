Church Slavonic spelling dictionaries for Hunspell

This package provides spelling dictionaries for Church Slavonic
for [Hunspell](https://hunspell.github.io/).

## Quick Start

Copy the `cu.aff` and `cu.dic` files into the Hunspell directory
(probably `/usr/share/hunspell/`). You can find the directory by running
`hunspell -D`.

Extensions also exist for LibreOffice and other software, which
are based on this package; see, for example:

## Issues

At present, this is a poorman's spell checker:

- Unicode Normalization (UAX #15) and case folding are not
natively supported by Hunspell. As a workaround, the dictionary
includes all words in both NFC and NFD forms, as well as
uppercase forms of certain words. (This negatively impacts memory usage).

- Only numerals between а҃ (1) and ҂ѳцч҃ѳ (9999) will be recognized.
Other numerals may be treated as misspelled.

- The dictionary does not provide any morphology.

Morphological analysis for Church Slavonic is hard to do. Since
we presently don't have the resources to write morphology into
the dictionary, the spell checker will only check the words present
in the dictionary. In other words, if the dictionary contains:

```
кни́га
кни́гꙋ
кни́зи
```

The spell checker will recognize these words, but it will treat
`кни́зѣ`, `кни́гами` and `кни́жный` as misspelled.
